## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser to see the result.

When you make edits, the page will automatically reload.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more information, see the [Running Tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.

The build files will be minified, and the filenames will contain hashes.\
Your app is now ready to be deployed!

For more information, see the [Deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section.

### `npm run eject`

**Warning: This operation is irreversible. Once you eject, you can’t go back!**

If you’re not satisfied with the build tools and configuration, you can eject at any time. This command will copy all configuration files and dependencies (such as webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts, allowing you to customize as needed. After ejecting, you will need to maintain these configurations yourself.

You don’t have to eject. The default setup is suitable for most small to medium deployments, and there’s no pressure to eject. However, we understand that if you’re unable to customize the configuration when you’re ready, this tool loses its value.
