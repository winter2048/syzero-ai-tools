# Quick Start with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open <http://localhost:3000> to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more information, see the [Running Tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

For more information, see the [Deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section.

### `npm run eject`

**Warning: This operation is irreversible. Once you eject, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration, you can eject at any time. This command will copy all configuration files and dependencies (like webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can modify them as needed. After ejecting, you will need to maintain these configurations yourself.

You don’t have to eject to use Create React App. The default setup is suitable for most small to medium-sized deployments, and there’s no pressure to eject. However, we understand that if you’re unable to customize the configuration when you’re ready, the tool loses its value.
